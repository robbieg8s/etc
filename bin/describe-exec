# Unambigously describe how we were exec'd
# - If HALFYAK_DESCRIBE_EXEC_STDERR is set in environment, write describe output there,
#   rather than stderr.

# Feature backlog:
# - If HALFYAK_DESCRIBE_EXEC_FORWARD is set in environment, exec that with $@
#   when we are done.  If not, but if [[ $0:A != $0 ]], then behave as if
#   HALFYAK_DESCRIBE_EXEC_FORWARD was set to whence -a "${0##*/}" | sed -ne 2p
# - If HALFYAK_DESCRIBE_EXEC_STDIN is set in environment, capture stdin to that
#   file. If also ..._FORWARD, use tee to capture, wrap and forward.
# - If HALFYAK_DESCRIBE_EXEC_STDOUT is set in environment, cat that to stdout.
#   If also ..._FORWARD, instead use tee to capture the stdout from the wrapped process.
# - If HALFYAK_DESCRIBE_EXEC_STDERR and ..._FORWARD, use tee to capture the stderr
#   from the wrapped process also.
