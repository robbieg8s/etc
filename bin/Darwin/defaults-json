# Read the macos defaults for a domain and render as json. The read is done via defaults export, because it
# produces easily parseable output.  Note `defaults export` is undocumented by `defaults(1)`, but `defaults
# -help` mentions it.

# Unlike defaults read, defaults export requires a domain.
domain="${1:?}"

# Note that defaults emits the xml form when writing to stdout, which we convert then use jq to wrap in an object
# with the domain as key.  In principle the wrapping could be done by xslt processing in plist-xml1-json, by using
# a -stringparam argument and more code, but that would complicate re-use by plist-json. This would boost performance -
# a quick test (my M2 Air) just removing the wrapping reduces a 5-6 second process by 0.5 - 1 seconds.
