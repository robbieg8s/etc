# Emit the value of a fresh `traceparent` header per https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/#traceparent-header
# In future, we should provide a way to optionally contextually provide received traceparent so we can
# implement https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/#a-traceparent-is-received
# An option for emitting the whole http header would be nice too
# A mechanism for saving the id would be nice too, for now it is expected curl --verbose or similar is used

# NB: Darwin uuidgen is capitalized, alpine is not. Both contain hyphens.
