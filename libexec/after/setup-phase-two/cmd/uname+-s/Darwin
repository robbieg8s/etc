# Install custom LaunchAgents, expanding environment variables as we do.
# We do the expansion since launchd.plist(5) provides no mechanism for variability here, and i don't
# want to hardcode my username. An alternative would be to put symlinks in a stable place, for
# example /opt/halfyak, but that is intrinsically not multiuser, and would to be done for multiple
# links over time, such as when using WatchPaths.

# We do this in two stages - expanding to intermediate storage, and then linking from where macOS
# looks for them to that. This makes it easy to lean on link-config to remove old ones without
# interfering with files from other applications. We use XDG_CACHE_HOME for intermediate storage -
# this isn't really a cache, but it feels like a reasonable enough place.
